# PowerBi_Dashboard_Project
This is My First Project
**This project id end to end encrypted**.
You’ve just been hired as a Business Intelligence Analyst by AdventureWorks*, a global
manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories.
The management team needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare
regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.
All you’ve been given is a folder of raw csv files, which contain information about
transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.
**Use Power BI Desktop to:**
• Connect and transform the raw data
• Build a relational data model
• Create calculated columns and measures with DAX
• Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data
